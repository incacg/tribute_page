        <h3 id="headline">A simple timeline of Elon Musk</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Paypal</strong> - In March 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an
            online financial services and e-mail payment company, with US$10
            million from the sale of Zip2. One year later, the company merged
            with Confinity, which had a money-transfer service called PayPal.
            The merged company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed
            PayPal in 2001. Musk was ousted in October 2000 from his role as CEO
            (although he remained on the board) due to disagreements with other
            company executives over his desire to move PayPal's Unix-based
            infrastructure to a Microsoft one. In October 2002, PayPal was
            acquired by eBay for US$1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk received
            US$165 million. Before its sale, Musk, who was the company's largest
            shareholder, owned 11.7% of PayPal's shares. In July 2017, Musk
            purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount,
            stating that it has sentimental value to him.[73]

          <li>
            <strong>SpaceX</strong> - With US$100 million of his early fortune,
            Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp., traded as SpaceX,
            in May 2002. Musk is chief executive officer (CEO) and chief
            technology officer (CTO) of the Hawthorne, California-based company.
            By 2016, Musk's private trust held 54% of SpaceX stock, equivalent
            to 78% of voting shares. SpaceX develops and manufactures space
            launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket
            technology. The company's first two launch vehicles were the Falcon
            1 and Falcon 9 rockets (a nod to Star Wars' Millennium Falcon), and
            its first spacecraft was the Dragon (a nod to Puff the Magic
            Dragon). SpaceX designed a family of launch vehicles and the Dragon
            multipurpose spacecraft over a span of seven years. In September
            2008, SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket became the first privately funded
            liquid-fueled vehicle to put a satellite into Earth orbit.

            <strong>Tesla</strong> - Tesla, Inc. (originally Tesla Motors) was
            incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning,
            who financed the company until the Series A round of funding. Both
            men played active roles in the company's early development prior to
            Elon Musk's involvement. Musk led the Series A round of investment
            in February 2004, joining Tesla's board of directors as its
            chairman. According to Musk, all three, along with J. B. Straubel,
            were inspired by the earlier AC Propulsion tzero electric roadster
            prototype. Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw
            Roadster product design at a detailed level, but was not deeply
            involved in day-to-day business operations. Following the financial
            crisis in 2008 and after a series of escalating conflicts in 2007,
            Eberhard was ousted from the firm. Musk assumed leadership of the
            company as CEO and product architect in 2008, positions he still
            holds today. As of 2019, Elon Musk is the longest tenured CEO of any
            automotive manufacturer globally.

          <li>
            <strong>Neuralink</strong> - In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a
            neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with
            artificial intelligence. The company is centered on creating devices
            that can be implanted in the human brain, with the eventual purpose
            of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with
            advancements in artificial intelligence. These enhancements could
            improve memory or allow more direct interfacing with computing
            devices. Musk sees Neuralink and OpenAI as related: "OpenAI is a
            nonprofit dedicated to minimizing the dangers of artificial
            intelligence, while Neuralink is working on ways to implant
            technology into our brains to create mind-computer interfaces."

            <strong>The Boring Company</strong> - On December 17, 2016, while
            stuck in traffic, Musk tweeted "[I] am going to build a tunnel
            boring machine and just start digging ..." The company was named
            'The Boring Company' (TBC). On January 21, 2017, Musk tweeted
            "Exciting progress on the tunnel front. Plan to start digging in a
            month or so." As of January 26, 2017, discussions with regulatory
            bodies had begun. In February 2017, the company began digging a
            30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep
            "test trench" on the premises of Space X's offices in Los Angeles,
            since the construction requires no permits. Musk had said in early
            2017 that a 10-fold decrease in tunnel boring cost per mile is
            necessary for economic feasibility of the proposed tunnel network.
            According to Tesla and SpaceX board member Steve Jurvets, the tunnel
            width is optimized for electric vehicles only, which avoids
            complications of exhaust venting with internal combustion engines.
            By late 2018, TBC had active construction, approved plans in place,
            or an operational tunnel in several areas of the United States:
            Baltimore, Chicago and Los Angeles. TBC provided an update on the
            state of their technology and product line when they opened to the
            public their first mile-long test tunnel in Hawthorne, California,
            on December 18, 2018, saying it has been a proof-of-concept for the
            technology. TBC has claimed that design is complete for their next
            tunnel boring machine (TBM), Prufrock, and that assembly and
            engineering testing would begin in 2019. In February 2020 TBC
            released images of a working Prufrock prototype.
